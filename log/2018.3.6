Questions:

How to effectively merge different classes into a bigger class, with messing up all attributes?

For now, the Matrix system has been defined; however, movement rules are required.

Also, the matrix has to be externally passed to a different OBJECT, an instance of GameWindow, to update the Matrix in it.
Would be nice if we can have it as an internal matrix.

Labels have to be packed into tiles, which are essentially Frames, which are convinient to bind to.

The biggest potential issue at this point is that, the coordinate system in tkinter are different from ordinary.

Seems like Tk defines origin of X,Y at the top left corner, and my assumption was that it starts at the bottom left corner.


Next steps:
1. Bind  Matrix --> IntVars --> Labels --> Frames -->


2. Possibly using callbacks to register which IntVars have changes its value?

3. Static in position: Labels, Variables;

   Dynamic with animation: Tiles
