This project will be written bottom-up.
Bottom-up is a relatively safer approach in engineering, because it is easier to debug each part first
before putting everything altogether.
Top-down does offer a generally easier start, but not for more complex programs.

Stage 1:

Core Classes:

GameBoard (Static)

Blocks  (Generate,Color
	Animation)

Matrix (Storage, Movement Rules,
	Calculations)

Movement Binding

Score Printing



Matrix manipulation ---> GameWindow 'mat' update  ---> 'Variables' update --->  'Labels' update


Should have used text instead of Labels. But I can just sychronize background color of label with bg color of cells,
making it no different to text(in this situation).
